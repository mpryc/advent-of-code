# Task:
# The homework (your puzzle input) consists of a series of expressions that
# consist of addition (+), multiplication (*), and parentheses ((...)).
# Just like normal math, parentheses indicate that the expression inside
# must be evaluated before it can be used by the surrounding expression.
# Addition still finds the sum of the numbers on both sides of the operator,
# and multiplication still finds the product.
# However, the rules of operator precedence have changed. Rather than
# evaluating multiplication before addition, the operators have the same
# precedence, and are evaluated left-to-right regardless of the order
# in which they appear.
# Before you can help with the homework, you need to understand it yourself.
# Evaluate the expression on each line of the homework; what is the sum
# of the resulting values?
#
# Solution:
# We read the input file, treating each line as a formula to calculate.
# Then we iterate over the formulas in a loop, every time doing basically
# two actions â€“ reducing the brackets (calculating the value of sub-formula
# between brackets and inserting it instead of part of the original formula),
# then we simply do calculate what remains (additions and multiplications).
# The function that reduces the brackets goes as long as there is opening
# and closing bracket in the equation, first finding the most right opening
# bracket and then the first closing bracket after this one.
#
