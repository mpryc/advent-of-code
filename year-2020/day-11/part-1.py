# Task:
# The seat layout fits neatly on a grid. Each position is either floor (.),
# an empty seat (L), or an occupied seat (#).
# The following rules are applied to every seat simultaneously in a round:
# - If a seat is empty (L) and there are no occupied seats adjacent to it,
#   the seat becomes occupied.
# - If a seat is occupied (#) and four or more seats adjacent to it are also
#   occupied, the seat becomes empty.
# - Otherwise, the seat's state does not change.
# Floor (.) never changes; seats don't move, and nobody sits on the floor.
# Simulate your seating area by applying the seating rules repeatedly until
# no seats change state. How many seats end up occupied?
#
# Solution:
# First we read the input file as a 2-dimensional array of single characters.
# Then in a loop, we copy current array (grid) and process every element in it
# to satisfy the mentioned rules. We break the loop when there was no change.
# The key here is find the neighbors of a current seat (position in grid)
# properly â€“ taking into account that some elements does not exist on the
# edges. For this we use a function that returns some default value instead
# of IndexError or in case of negative indexes (this emulates get() method
# from the dictionaries in Python).
