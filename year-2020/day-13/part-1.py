# Task:
# To save time once you arrive, your goal is to figure out the earliest
# bus you can take to the airport. (There will be exactly one such bus.)
# What is the ID of the earliest bus you can take to the airport
# multiplied by the number of minutes you'll need to wait for that bus?
#
# Solution:
# We read the first line from the input file as a current time and then
# the next line as an array of bus lines numbers, ignoring the values 'x'.
# Then for each bus line number, we find the smallest number greater than
# current time, that is divisible by this bus line number â€“ that would be
# the next time of departure. Then we simply multiply the difference between
# current time and the departure time by the bus line number it would be.
