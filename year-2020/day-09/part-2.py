# Task:
# The final step in breaking the XMAS encryption relies on the invalid number
# you just found: you must find a contiguous set of at least two numbers in
# your list which sum to the invalid number from step 1.
# To find the encryption weakness, add together the smallest and largest
# number in this contiguous range.
# What is the encryption weakness in your XMAS-encrypted list of numbers?
#
# Solution:
# Here we just implement another sliding window on the input list of numbers,
# but with various width â€“ from minimum size 2 to the end of array. Then we
# produce a subset of that window and calculate a sum of its elements.
# If it is equal to our wrong number, we have what we need.
# The additional break, if sum for current start and window size exceeds
# already our target number, reduces the processing time significantly.
