# Task:
# How many bag colors can eventually contain at least one shiny gold bag?
#
# Solution:
# Here we just reverse the look through the tree â€“ we have a list of bags
# we want to find and counts its children, then in loop we go through the
# input and count the children of wanted bag, adding also these children
# as the next bags to go though in list.
